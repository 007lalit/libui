- consider calling setAppleMenu: for the application menu; it doesn't seem to make much of a difference but
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4543087/applicationwillterminate-and-the-dock-but-wanting-to-cancel-this-action

ultimately:
- add some sort of runtime type checking
- MAYBE readd lifetime handling/destruction blocking
- assign control IDs on windows
	- GWL(P)_ID
	- related? [12:25] <ZeroOne> And the blue outline on those buttons [ALL clicked buttons on Windows 7] won't go away
		- I get this too
- SWP_NOCOPYBITS to avoid button redraw issues on Windows when not in tab, but only when making resize faster
- opposite side alignment control in uiBox
- collapse multiple consecutive menu separators?
	- including for quit/preferences/about?
		- or not even have separators there?
			- in which case, hide leading or trailing separators?
- generate libui.lib and related files
- make OS-specific headers generated by an IDL
- bin.c
	- find a way to move the has parent check at the beginning of binDestroy()
- menu item state change while the menu is visible (not in response to user action)
	- OS X: requires an [NSMenu update] call after changing state
	- Windows: requires getting current menu state when amending it in sync()
- figure out where we should return HRESULTs
- Windows: don't abort if a cleanup function fails?
- drop "Page" from uiTab method names? (uiTabAppendPage() -> uiTabAppend())
- make it so Windows API calls that do logLastError(), etc. abort whatever they're doing and not try to continue, just like wintable
- 32-bit Mac OS X support (requires lots of code changes)
	- change the build system to be more receptive to arch changes

notes to self
- explicitly document label position at top-left corner
- mark that uiControlShow() on a uiWindow() will bring to front and give keyboard focus because of OS X
	- make sure ShowWindow() is sufficient for zorder on Windows
- document that you can't use InsertBefore functions to insert before a nonexistent index (that includes if an array is empty)
	- reconsider this, as the pointer array code does work with the first invalid index...
		- we would need to test everything else with it
- note that uiTabInsertPageBefore() does NOT change the current tab page (it may change its index if inserting before the current page)
- note that the default action for uiWindowOnClosing() is to return 0 (keep the window open)
- note that uiInitOptions should be initialized to zero
- explicitly document that uiCheckboxSetChecked() and uiEntrySetText() do not fire uiCheckboxOnToggled() and uiEntryOnChanged(), respectively
- note that uiControlResize() on a uiContainer also updates
- note that if a menu is requested on systems with menubars on windows but no menus are defined, the result is a blank menubar, with whatever that means left up to the OS to decide
