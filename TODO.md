- change all private names away from uiXxxx and uipXxxx
- make it so Windows API calls that do logLastError(), etc. abort whatever they're doing and not try to continue, just like wintable
- figure out what to cleanup in darwin terminate:
	- delegate
	- deleted objects view
- assign control IDs on windows
	- GWL(P)_ID
	- related? [12:25] <ZeroOne> And the blue outline on those buttons [ALL clicked buttons on Windows 7] won't go away
		- I get this too
- make sure all terminology is consistent
- 32-bit Mac OS X support (requires lots of code changes)
- add a test for hidden controls when a window is shown
- SWP_NOCOPYBITS (or was it WS_CLIPCHILDREN?)
	- buttons not in tab get drawover issues
	- buttons in tab without transparent drawing code get copied into the label when stack shown and rehidden
- settle differences between intmax_t and uintmax_t
- settle onDestroy/destroy naming
- implement lifetiming on Windows
- forbid free(NULL) to check for bugs
- opposite side alignment control in uiBox
- disabling containers on wine doesn't redraw children as disabled
	- TODO test on real windows

ultimately:
- add some sort of runtime type checking
- MAYBE readd lifetime handling/destruction blocking
- figure out how to integrate leak checking into the source tree
