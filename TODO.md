- change all private names away from uiXxxx and uipXxxx
- make it so Windows API calls that do logLastError(), etc. abort whatever they're doing and not try to continue, just like wintable
- figure out what to cleanup in darwin terminate:
	- delegate
	- deleted objects view
- assign control IDs on windows
	- GWL(P)_ID
	- related? [12:25] <ZeroOne> And the blue outline on those buttons [ALL clicked buttons on Windows 7] won't go away
		- I get this too
- make sure all terminology is consistent
- 32-bit Mac OS X support (requires lots of code changes)
- add a test for hidden controls when a window is shown
- SWP_NOCOPYBITS (or was it WS_CLIPCHILDREN?)
	- buttons not in tab get drawover issues
	- buttons in tab without transparent drawing code get copied into the label when stack shown and rehidden
- settle differences between intmax_t and uintmax_t
- settle onDestroy/destroy naming
- implement lifetiming on Windows
- forbid free(NULL) to check for bugs
- opposite side alignment control in uiBox
- disabling containers on wine doesn't redraw children as disabled
	- test on real windows
- collapse multiple consecutive menu separators?
	- including for quit/preferences/about?
		- or not even have separators there?
			- in which case, hide leading or trailing separators?
- write an array.c for uiBox, uiGrid, and the Windows backend
	- it'd just be a clone of GArray from GLib
- add the visibility stuff to the Windows makefile
	- figure out visibility on mac os x
	- hide command lines in the makefile
- rename newcontrol.[cm] to control.[cm] or something else?
- use _UI_EXPORT on OS-specific functions
	- make their headers generated by an IDL
- make sure complain()s don't have \n at the end; add one on each platform
	- add a `[libui]` to the beginning of the message

ultimately:
- add some sort of runtime type checking
- MAYBE readd lifetime handling/destruction blocking
- figure out how to integrate leak checking into the source tree

notes to self
- explicitly document label position at top-left corner
