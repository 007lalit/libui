- change all private names to uipXxxx
- make it so Windows API calls that do logLastError(), etc. abort whatever they're doing and not try to continue, just like wintable
- figure out what to cleanup in darwin terminate:
	- delegate
	- deleted objects view
- assign control IDs on windows
	- GWL(P)_ID
	- related? [12:25] <ZeroOne> And the blue outline on those buttons [ALL clicked buttons on Windows 7] won't go away
		- I get this too
- make sure all terminology is consistent
- 32-bit Mac OS X support (requires lots of code changes)
- add a test for hidden controls when a window is shown
- SWP_NOCOPYBITS (or was it WS_CLIPCHILDREN?)
	- buttons not in tab get drawover issues
	- buttons in tab without transparent drawing code get copied into the label when stack shown and rehidden
- make the backends use uiParentDestroy() instead of relying on the autodestroy behavior of the backends
	- this requires explicitly handling delete events
- verify retainment for uiParents in GTK+
- add an example of events to each of the new controls guides
- verify that uiParentSetMainControl() does indeed not update
- settle differences between intmax_t and uintmax_t
- make destroy functions take the control as an argument
- settle onDestroy/destroy naming
- clean up Unix lifetiming code

ultimately:
- make everything vtable-based
	- figure out where updateParent() plays into this
		- figure out what to do about custom containers
		- make the code flow of all platforms fully symmetrical
- add some sort of runtime type checking
